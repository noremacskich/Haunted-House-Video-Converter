Basically this app is meant to help me convert Q-See videos into a readable format for youtube.  It will also help me rename and move the files.


Eventually I would like to have some sort of display showing how many videos remain, and how many videos have been converted, prefereably by channel.

Also, to speed up the conversion, i would like to have multiple different conversions going on at once, so have threading of some sort.

Maybe have a youtube API going on, if it is possible to do so, haven't looked yet
